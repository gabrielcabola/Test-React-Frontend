## Articles API Frontend 

----
### Description
Create as a SPA in React.

### Considerations
- The Application was designed to have a State/Context by module in this project has only the Article Module.
- Was not included a global State/Context or localstorage, that normally is necessary on the High App level.
- PWA features are not improved and tested.
